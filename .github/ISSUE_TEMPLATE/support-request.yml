        This repository hosts issues for the Swift OpenAPI generator, the Swift
        OpenAPI runtime library, the Swift OpenAPI URLSession transport library,
        and the AsyncHTTPClient transport library.
        It does *not* track feedback on Xcode and other closed source Apple
        developer software such as URLSession itself; please direct it to
        [Feedback Assistant](https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting) instead.
