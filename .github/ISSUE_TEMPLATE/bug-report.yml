        This repository hosts issues for the Swift OpenAPI generator, the Swift
        OpenAPI runtime library, the Swift OpenAPI URLSession transport library,
        and the AsyncHTTPClient transport library.
        It does *not* track feedback on Xcode and other closed source Apple
        developer software such as URLSession itself; please direct it to
        [Feedback Assistant](https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting) instead.

      label: Description
      description: >
        A concise description of what causes the problem, in human language.
        Though not required, it may help us to more accurately triage the issue
        as well as understand a non-trivial test case.

      label: Reproduction
      description: >
        Please provide inputs to help us reproduce the issue.

        If the issue relates to code generation, provide an example OpenAPI
        document, a generator configuration file, and extract of the Swift
        code you believe to contain the issue. If generation fails, please
        provide the generator output.

        If the issue is with using the generated code, or the runtime or
        transport libraries, provide a test case, provide sample Swift code, and
        explain how to build or run it to reproduce the problem.

        If the problem is a poor or unexpected error, warning, or output, please
        show them.

        Consider reducing the test case to the smallest amount of code possible
        — a smaller test case is easier to reason about and more appealing to
        contributors.
