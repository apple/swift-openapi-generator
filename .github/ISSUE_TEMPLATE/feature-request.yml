        This repository hosts issues for the Swift OpenAPI generator, the Swift
        OpenAPI runtime library, the Swift OpenAPI URLSession transport library,
        and the AsyncHTTPClient transport library.
        It does *not* track feedback on Xcode and other closed source Apple
        developer software such as URLSession itself; please direct it to
        [Feedback Assistant](https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting) instead.

        ___

        For non-trivial changes that affect the public API, the Swift OpenAPI
        Generator project adopts a ligthweight version of the [Swift
        Evolution](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/process.md)
        process.

        Writing a proposal first helps discuss multiple possible solutions
        early, apply useful feedback from other contributors, and avoid
        reimplementing the same feature multiple times.

        Use this issue template to start discussion about your feature request.
