### Introduction

A key goal of Swift OpenAPI Generator is to generate code that faithfully
represents the OpenAPI document[[0]] and is capable of remaining as expressive
as the OpenAPI specification, in which operations can have one of several
responses (e.g. `200`, `204`), each of which can have one of several response
bodies (e.g. `application/json`, `text/plain`).

Consequently, the generated code allows for exhaustive type-safe handling of
all possible responses (including undocumented responses) by using nested enum
values for the HTTP status and the body.

However, for simple operations that have just one documented outcome, the
generated API seems overly verbose to use. We discuss a concrete example in the
following section.

### Motivation

To motivate the proposal we will consider a trivial API which returns
a personalized greeting. The OpenAPI document for this service is provided in
an appendix, but its behaviour is illustrated with the following API call from
the terminal:

```console
% curl 'localhost:8080/api/greet?name=Maria'
{ "message" : "Hello, Maria" }
```

The generated API protocols define one function per OpenAPI operation. These
functions take a single input parameter that holds all the operation inputs
(header fields, query items, cookies, body, etc.). Consequently, when making an
API call, there is an additional initializer to call. This presents unnecessary
ceremony, especially when calling operations with no parameters or only default
parameters.

```swift
// before (with parameters)
_ = try await client.getGreeting(Operations.getGreeting.Input(
    query: Operations.getGreeting.Input.Query(name: "Maria")
))

// before (with parameters, shorthand)
_ = try await client.getGreeting(.init(query: .init(name: "Maria")))

// before (no parameters, shorthand)
_ = try await client.getGreeting(.init()))
```

The generated `Output` type for each API operation is an enum with cases for
each documented response and a case for an undocumented response. Following
this pattern, the `Output.Body` is also an enum with cases for every documented
content type for the response.

While this API encourages users to handle all possible scenarios, it leads to
ceremony when the user requires a specific response and receiving anything else
is considered an error. This is especially apparent for API operations that
have just a single response, e.g. `OK`, and a single content type, e.g.
`application/json`.

```swift
// before
switch try await client.getGreeting() {
case .ok(let response):
    switch response.body {
    case .json(let body):
        print(body.message)
    }
case .undocumented(statusCode: _, _):
    throw UnexpectedResponseError()
}
```

For users who wish to get an expected response or fail, they will have to
define their own error type. They may also make use of `guard case let ... else
{ throw ... }` which reduces the code, but still presents additional ceremony.

### Proposed solution

To simplify providing inputs, generate an overload for each operation that
lifts each of the parameters of `Input.init` as function parameters. This
removes the need for users to call `Input.init`, which streamlines the API
call, especially when the user does not need to provide parameters.

```swift
// after (with parameters, shorthand)
_ = try await client.getGreeting(query: .init(name: "Maria"))

// after (no parameters)
_ = try await client.getGreeting()
```

To simplify handling outputs, provide a throwing computed property for each
enum case related to a documented outcome, which will return the associated
value for the expected case, or throw a runtime error if the value is
a different enum case. This allows for expressing the expected outcome as
a chained operation.

```swift
// after
print(try await client.getGreeting().ok.body.json.message)
//                     ^             ^       ^
//                     |             |       `- (New) Throws if body did not conform to documented JSON.
//                     |             |
//                     |             `- (New) Throws if HTTP response is not 200 (OK).
//                     |
//                     `- (Existing) Throws if there is an error making the API call.
```

### Detailed design

The following listing is a relevant subset of the code that is currently
generated for our example API. The comments have been changed for the audience
of this proposal. The entire code is contained in an appendix.

```swift
public protocol APIProtocol: Sendable {
    // A function requirement is generated for each operation. It takes an
    // input type, comprising all parameters, and returns an output type, which
    // is an nested enum covering all possible responses.
    func getGreeting(_ input: Operations.getGreeting.Input) async throws -> Operations.getGreeting.Output
}

public enum Operations {
    public enum getGreeting {
        public struct Input: Sendable, Hashable {
            // If all parameters have default values, then the initializer
            // parameter also has a default value.
            public init(
                query: Operations.getGreeting.Input.Query = .init(),
                headers: Operations.getGreeting.Input.Headers = .init()
            ) {
                self.query = query
                self.headers = headers
            }
        }
        @frozen public enum Output: Sendable, Hashable {
            public struct Ok: Sendable, Hashable {
                @frozen public enum Body: Sendable, Hashable {
                    case json(Components.Schemas.Greeting)
                }
                public var body: Operations.getGreeting.Output.Ok.Body
                public init(body: Operations.getGreeting.Output.Ok.Body) { self.body = body }
            }
            // An enum case is generated for each documented response.
            case ok(Operations.getGreeting.Output.Ok)
            // An additional enum case is generated for any undocumented response.
            case undocumented(statusCode: Int, OpenAPIRuntime.UndocumentedPayload)
        }
    }
}
```

This proposal covers generating the following additional API surface to
simplify providing inputs.
 
```swift
extension APIProtocol {
    // The parameters to each overload will match those of the corresponding
    // operation input initializer, including optionality.
    public func getGreeting(
        query: Operations.getGreeting.Input.Query = .init(),
        headers: Operations.getGreeting.Input.Headers = .init()
    ) {
        // Simply wraps the call to the protocol function in an input value.
        getGreeting(Operations.getGreeting.Input(
            query: query,
            headers: headers
        ))
    }
}
```

This proposal also covers generating the following additional API surface to
simplify handling outputs.

```swift 
// Note: Generating an extension is not prescriptive; implementations may
// generate these properties within the primary type definition.
extension Operations.getGreeting.Output {
    // A throwing computed property is generated for each documented outcome.
    var ok: Operations.getGreeting.Output.Ok {
        get throws {
            guard case let .ok(response) = self else {
                // This error will be added to the OpenAPIRuntime library.
                throw UnexpectedResponseError(expected: "ok", actual: self)
            }
            return response
        }
    }
    // Note: a property is _not_ generated for the undocumented enum case.
}

// Note: Generating an extension is not prescriptive; implementations may
// generate these properties within the primary type definition.
extension Operations.getGreeting.Output.Ok.Body {
    // A throwing computed property is generated for each document content type.
    var json: Components.Schemas.Greeting {
        get throws {
            guard case let .json(body) = self else {
                // This error will be added to the OpenAPIRuntime library.
                throw UnexpectedContentError(expected: "json", actual: self)
            }
            return body
        }
    }
}
```

### API stability

This change is purely API additive:

- Additional SPI in the runtime library
- Additional API in the generated code

### Future directions

Nothing in this proposal.

### Alternatives considered

#### Providing macros

A macro library could be used in conjunction with the existing generated code.

However, this proposal does not consider this a viable option for two reasons:

1. We currently support Swift 5.8; and
2. Adopters that rely on ahead-of-time generation will not benefit.

#### Making this an opt-in feature

There generator could conditionally generate this code, e.g. using
a configuration option, or hiding the generated code behind an SPI.

This proposal does so unconditionally in the spirit of _making easy things,
easy._ Based on adopter feedback, enough users want to be able to do this that
it should be very discoverable on first use.
