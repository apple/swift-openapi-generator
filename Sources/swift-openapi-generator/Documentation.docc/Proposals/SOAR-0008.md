### Introduction

When generating client code, Swift OpenAPI Generator generates code for the
entire OpenAPI document, even if the user only makes use of a subset of its
types and operations.

Generating code that is unused constitutes overhead for the adopter:
- The overhead of generating code for unused types and operations
- The overhead of compiling the generated code
- The overhead of unused code in the users codebase (AOT generation)

This is particularly noticeable when working with a small subset of
a large API, which can result in O(100k) lines of unused code and long
generation and compile times.

The initial scope of the Swift OpenAPI Generator was to focus only on
generating Swift code from an OpenAPI document, and any preprocessing of the
OpenAPI document was considered out of scope. The proposed answer to this was
to preprocess the document before providing to the generator[[0]].

Even with tooling, filtering the document requires more than just filtering the
YAML or JSON document for the deterministic keys for the desired operations
because such operations likely contain JSON references to the reusable types in
the document's `components` dictionary, and these components can themselves
contain references. Consequently, in order to filter an OpenAPI document for
a single operation requires including the transitive closure of the operations
referenced dependencies.

Furthermore, it's common that Swift OpenAPI Generator adopters do not own the
OpenAPI document, and simply vendor it from the service owner. In these cases,
it presents a user experience hurdle to have to edit the document, and
a maintenance burden to continue to do so when updating the document to a new
version.

Because this problem has a general solution that is non-trivial to implement,
this proposal covers adding opt-in, configurable document filtering to the
generator, to improve the user experience for those using a subset of a large
API.

### Motivation

Many real-world APIs have hundreds of endpoints and types. Consider the Github
API, whose OpenAPI document is >230k lines. It describes ~900 endpoints and >1200
reusable components. Running the generator with `--mode types` for this API
takes 41 seconds[^1] and results in >450k LOC, which presents a bottleneck
in the build when compiling the generated code.

```console
% cat api.github.com.yaml | wc -l
231063

% cat api.github.com.yaml | yq '.paths.* | keys' | wc -l
898

% cat api.github.com.yaml | yq '.components.* | keys' | wc -l
1260

% time ./swift-openapi-generator.release \
  generate \
  --mode types \
  --config openapi-generator-config.yaml \
  api.github.com.yaml
Writing data to file Types.swift...

real    0m41.397s
user    0m40.912s
sys     0m0.456s

% cat Types.swift | wc -l
458852
```

OpenAPI has support for grouping operations by tag. For example, the OpenAPI
document for the Github API has the following tags:

```console
% cat api.github.com.yaml | yq '[.tags[].name] | join(", ")'
actions, activity, apps, billing, checks, code-scanning, codes-of-conduct,
emojis, dependabot, dependency-graph, gists, git, gitignore, issues, licenses,
markdown, merge-queue, meta, migrations, oidc, orgs, packages, projects, pulls,
rate-limit, reactions, repos, search, secret-scanning, teams, users,
codespaces, copilot, security-advisories, interactions, classroom
```

If a user wants to make use of just the parts of the API that relate to Github
issues, then they could work with a much smaller document. For example,
filtering for only operations tagged `issues` (including all components on
which those operations depend) results in an OpenAPI document that is just 25k
lines with 40 operations and 90 reusable components, comprising a ~90%
reduction in these dimensions.

Running the generator with `--mode types` with this filtered API document
takes just 1.6 seconds[^1] and results in < 15k LOC, which is 20x faster and
a 95% reduction in generated code.

```console
% cat issues.api.github.com.yaml | wc -l
25314

% cat issues.api.github.com.yaml | yq '.paths.* | keys' | wc -l
40

% cat issues.api.github.com.yaml | yq '.components.* | keys' | wc -l
90

% time ./swift-openapi-generator.filter.release \
  generate \
  --mode types \
  --config openapi-generator-config.yaml \
  issues.api.github.com.yaml
Writing data to file Types.swift...

real    0m1.638s
user    0m1.595s
sys     0m0.031s

% cat Types.swift | wc -l
14691
```

### Proposed solution

We propose a configuable, opt-in filtering feature, which would run before
generation, allowing users to select the paths and schemas they are interested
in.

This would be driven by a new `filter` key in the config file used by the
generator.

```yaml
# filter:
#   paths:
#   - ...
#   tags:
#   - ...
#   operations:
#   - ...
#   schemas:
#   - ...
```

For example, to filter the document for only paths that contain operations
tagged with `issues` (along with the components on which those paths depend),
users could add the following to their config file.

```yaml
# openapi-generator-config.yaml
generate:
- types
- client

filter:
  tags:
  - issues
```

When this config key is present, the OpenAPI document will be filtered, before
generation, to contain the paths and schemas requested, along with the
transitive closure of components on which they depend.

This config key is optional; when it is not present, no filtering will take
place.

The following filters will be supported:

- `paths`: Includes the given paths, specified using the same keys as '#/paths'
  in the OpenAPI document.
- `tags`: Includes the operations with any of the given tags.
- `operations`: Includes the operations with these explicit operation IDs.
- `schemas`: Includes any schemas, specifid using the same keys as
  '#/components/schemas' in the OpenAPI document.

When multiple filters are specified, their union will be considered for
inclusion.

In all cases, the transitive closure of dependencies from the components
object will be included. 

[Appendix A](#appendix-a-examples) contains several examples on a real OpenAPI document.

### Detailed design

The config file is currently defined by an internal Codable struct, to which
a new, optional property has been added:

```diff
--- a/Sources/swift-openapi-generator/UserConfig.swift
+++ b/Sources/swift-openapi-generator/UserConfig.swift
@@ -27,6 +27,9 @@ struct _UserConfig: Codable {
     /// generated Swift file.
     var additionalImports: [String]?

+    /// Filter to apply to the OpenAPI document before generation.
+    var filter: DocumentFilter?
+
     /// A set of features to explicitly enable.
     var featureFlags: FeatureFlags?
 }
```

```swift
/// Rules used to filter an OpenAPI document.
struct DocumentFilter: Codable, Sendable {

    /// Operations with these tags will be included.
    var tags: [String]?

    /// Operations with these IDs will be included.
    var operations: [String]?

    /// These paths will be included in the filter.
    var paths: [OpenAPI.Path]?

    /// These schemas will be included.
    ///
    /// These schemas are included in  addition to the transitive closure of
    /// schema dependencies of the included paths.
    var schemas: [String]?
}
```

Note that these types are not being added to any Swift API; they are just used
to decode the `openapi-generator-config.yaml`.

### API stability

This change is purely API additive:

- Additional, optional keys in the config file schema.

### Future directions

#### Providing a `fitler` CLI command

Filtering the OpenAPI document has general utility beyond use within the
generator itself. In the future, we could consider adding a CLI for filtering.

### Alternatives considered

#### Not supporting including schema components

While the primary audience for this feature is adopters generating clients,
there are use cases where adopters may wish to interact with serialized data
that makes use of OpenAPI types. Indeed, OpenAPI is sometimes used as
a language-agnostic means of defining types outside of the context of a HTTP
service.

#### Supporting including other parts of the components object

While we chose to include schemas, for the reason highlighted above, we chose
_not_ to allow including other parts of the components object (e.g.
`parameters`, `requestBodies`, etc.).

That's because, unlike schemas, which have standalone utility, all other
components are only useful in conjuction with an API operation.
