### Introduction

A short, one-sentence overview of the feature or change.

### Motivation

Describe the problems that this proposal aims to address, and what workarounds adopters have to employ currently, if any.

### Proposed solution

Describe your solution to the problem. Provide examples and describe how they work. Show how your solution is better than current workarounds.

This section should focus on what will change for the _adopters_ of Swift OpenAPI Generator.

### Detailed design

Describe the implementation of the feature, a link to a prototype implementation is encouraged here.

This section should focus on what will change for the _contributors_ to Swift OpenAPI Generator.

### API stability

Discuss the API implications, making sure to considering all of:
- runtime public API
- runtime "Generated" SPI
- existing transport and middleware implementations
- generator implementation affected by runtime API changes
- generator API (config file, CLI, plugin)
- existing and new generated adopter code

### Future directions

Discuss any potential future improvements to the feature.

### Alternatives considered

Discuss the alternative solutions considered, even during the review process itself.
