### Introduction

Add streaming encoders and decoders for these three event stream formats to the runtime library, allowing adopters to easily produce and consume event streams, both on the client and server.

### Motivation

While the OpenAPI specification is optimized for HTTP APIs that send a single request value, and receive a single response value, there are many use cases in which developers want to stream values over time.

A simple example of streaming "values" is a file transfer, which can be thought of as a stream of byte chunks that represent the contents of the file. Another is multipart content, streaming individual parts over time. Both of these are already supported by Swift OpenAPI Generator, as of version 0.3.0 and 1.0.0-alpha.1, respectively.

Another popular use case for streaming is to send JSON-encoded events over time, usually (but not exclusively), from the server to the client.

- The [Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/) uses [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org) to stream updates to resources from its control plane.
- The [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/streaming) uses [Server-sent Events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#server-sent-events) to stream text snippets from ChatGPT.
- I couldn't find a popular service using JSON Sequence, but unlike JSON Lines, it's well-defined in [RFC7464](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7464), and also used around the industry.

The flow starts with the client initiating an HTTP request to the server, and the server responding with an HTTP response head, and then the server starting to stream the response body, which contains the delimited events, processed over time by the client.

This lightweight solution has the advantage of being a plain HTTP request/response pair, without requiring a custom protocol to either replace HTTP, or sit on top of it. This makes intermediaries, such as proxies, still able to pass data through without being aware of the streaming nature of the HTTP body.

### Proposed solution

Since the OpenAPI specification does not explicitly mention event streaming, it's up to tools, such as Swift OpenAPI Generator, to provide additional conveniences.

This proposed solution consists of two parts:
1. Add streaming encoders and decoders for the three event stream formats to the runtime library, represented as an `AsyncSequence` that converts elements between byte chunks and parsed events.
2. Provide examples for how adopters can then chain those sequences on the `HTTPBody` values they either produce or consume, in their code. No extra code would be generated.

Generally, the three event stream formats are associated with the following content types:
- JSON Lines: `application/jsonl`, `application/x-ndjson`
- JSON Sequence: `application/json-seq`
- Server-sent Events: `text/event-stream`

The generated code would continue to only vend the raw sequence of byte chunks (`HTTPBody`), and adopters could optionally chain the encoding/decoding sequence on it. For example, an OpenAPI document with a JSON Lines stream of `Greeting` values could contain the following:

```yaml
paths:
  /greetings:
    get:
      operationId: getGreetingsStream
      responses:
        '200':
          content:
            application/jsonl:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Greeting'
components:
  schemas:
    Greeting:
      type: object
      properties:
        ...
```

The important part is the `application/jsonl` (JSON Lines) content type (not to be confused with a plain `application/json` content type), and the event schema in `#/components/schemas`.

> Tip: For end-to-end working examples, check out the [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-generator/pull/494) adding example packages for all the formats.

#### Consuming event streams

As a consumer of such a body in Swift (usually on the client), you'd use one of the proposed methods, here `asDecodedJSONLines(of:decoder:)` to get a stream that parses the individual JSON lines and decodes each JSON object as a value of `Components.Schemas.Greeting`.

Then, you can read the stream, for example in a `for try await` loop.

```swift
let response = try await client.getGreetingsStream()
let httpBody = try response.ok.body.application_jsonl
let greetingStream = httpBody.asDecodedJSONLines(of: Components.Schemas.Greeting.self)
for try await greeting in greetingStream {
    print("Got greeting: \(greeting.message)")
}
```

#### Producing event streams

As a producer of such a body, start with a root async sequence, for example an `AsyncStream`, and submit events to it.

```swift
let (stream, continuation) = AsyncStream<Components.Schemas.Greeting>.makeStream()
// Pass the continuation to another task that calls 
// `continuation.yield(...)` with events, and `continuation.finish()` 
// at the end.

let httpBody = HTTPBody(
    stream.asEncodedJSONLines(),
    length: .unknown,
    iterationBehavior: .single
)
// Provide `httpBody` to the response, for example.
return .ok(.init(body: .application_jsonl(httpBody)))
```

### Detailed design

The rest of this section contains the Swift interface of the new API for the runtime library.

### API stability

Additive changes to the runtime library, no API changes to the generator or other components.

### Future directions

We could add additional event stream formats, if they become popular and well-defined in the industry.

### Alternatives considered

- Not doing anything - this would require adopters to write these encoders and decoders by hand, which is time-consuming, error prone, and duplicates effort across the ecosystem.
- Generating special types for these streams - this was rejected because it would force the adopter to parse the event stream, even if they instead wanted to forward it as raw data elsewhere. Since these event streams formats are not part of OpenAPI, it felt like a too strong of a limitation, which is why these conveniences are opt-in.
