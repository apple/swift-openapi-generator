# Starting with an example project

Duplicate a working example to start your project.

## Overview

All the examples are self-contained, so you can copy the package directory of your chosen example and use it as a starter template for your project.

### Getting started

TODO: Copy the contents of the Examples/README.md file here, and link to the github.com/... directory location.
