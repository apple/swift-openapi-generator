# Swift OpenAPI Generator

@Metadata {
    @TechnologyRoot()
}

Generate Swift client and server code from an OpenAPI document.

## Overview

[OpenAPI][openapi] is a specification for documenting HTTP services. An OpenAPI document is written in either YAML or JSON, and can be read by tools to help automate workflows, such as generating the necessary code to send and receive HTTP requests.

Swift OpenAPI Generator is a Swift package plugin that can generate the ceremony code required to make API calls, or implement API servers.

The code is generated at build-time, so it's always in sync with the OpenAPI document and doesn't need to be committed to your source repository.

## Features

- Works with OpenAPI Specification versions 3.0 and 3.1.
- Streaming request and response bodies enabling use cases such as JSON event streams, and large payloads without buffering.
- Support for JSON, multipart, URL-encoded form, base64, plain text, and raw bytes, represented as value types with type-safe properties.
- Client, server, and middleware abstractions, decoupling the generated code from the HTTP client library and web framework.

To see these features in action, see <doc:Checking-out-an-example-project>.

## Usage

Swift OpenAPI Generator can be used to generate API clients and server stubs.

Below you can see some example code, or you can follow one of the <doc:Swift-OpenAPI-Generator> tutorials.

### Using a generated API client

The generated `Client` type provides a method for each HTTP operation defined in the [OpenAPI document](#Example-OpenAPI-document) and can be used with any HTTP library that provides an implementation of `ClientTransport`.

```swift
import OpenAPIURLSession
import Foundation

let client = Client(
    serverURL: URL(string: "http://localhost:8080/api")!,
    transport: URLSessionTransport()
)
let response = try await client.getGreeting()
print(try response.ok.body.json.message)
```

### Using generated API server stubs

To implement a server, define a type that conforms to the generated `APIProtocol`, providing a method for each HTTP operation defined in the [OpenAPI document](#Example-OpenAPI-document).

The server can be used with any web framework that provides an implementation of `ServerTransport`, which allows you to register your API handlers with the HTTP server.

```swift
import OpenAPIRuntime
import OpenAPIVapor
import Vapor

struct Handler: APIProtocol {
    func getGreeting(_ input: Operations.getGreeting.Input) async throws -> Operations.getGreeting.Output {
        let name = input.query.name ?? "Stranger"
        return .ok(.init(body: .json(.init(message: "Hello, \(name)!"))))
    }
}

@main struct HelloWorldVaporServer {
    static func main() async throws {
        let app = Vapor.Application()
        let transport = VaporTransport(routesBuilder: app)
        let handler = Handler()
        try handler.registerHandlers(on: transport, serverURL: URL(string: "/api")!)
        try await app.execute()
    }
}
```

### Package ecosystem

The Swift OpenAPI Generator project is split across multiple repositories to enable extensibility and minimize dependencies in your project.
