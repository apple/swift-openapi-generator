/// A feature that can be explicitly enabled before being released.

/// Commonly used to get early feedback on breaking changes, before
/// they are enabled by default, which can only be done in a major version.
///
/// Once a feature is enabled unconditionally in the next major version,
/// the corresponding feature flag should be removed at the same time.
///
/// For example: a breaking feature is being built while version 0.1 is out,
/// and is hidden behind a feature flag. Once ready, the feature is
/// enabled unconditionally on main and the feature flag removed, and version
/// 0.2 is tagged. (This is for pre-1.0 versioning, would be 1.0 and 2.0 after
/// 1.0 is released.)
